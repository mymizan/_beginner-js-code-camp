# What is this?
I emphasize on learning to code by reading code. However, for those who have just mastered the basics of JavaScript, reading codebase of many open source projects are still complicated. 

So here, I have built some simple tools using JavaScript and different JavaScript frameworks to help you get started in reading code. 

Feel free to fork, and practice. 

# Who is this for?

These code samples often don't follow the best practices. They are written for the ones just getting started with Javascript, jQuery, and VueJS. The code demonstrates different JavaScript concepts using simple projects, easy to understand for starters. 

If you are an intermediate or a pro-programmer, these projects aren't for you. 

# What languages are used in these projects?
I have written the same project in VanillaJs, jQuery, Vuejs, Angular and React.
